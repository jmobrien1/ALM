Reach this active and engaged audience of American citizens who
support efforts to reign in out-of-control illegal immigration.  
These donors support Trump and his promises to strengthen our
nation’s borders, including the construction of a border wall along
the Mexican border.   More recently these donors supported the
President's tough stance against the Democats in Congress who
refused to pass funding of the Wall resulting in the 36-day
government shutdown.

Build the Wall Donors feel that it is time to put American citizens
first and, by doing so, create a stronger, safer more prosperous
USA.   These donors agree that it is through this safeguarding and
security America will remain united through the commonality of
citizenship -- regardless of race, religion. national orientation,
gender or sexual orientation.   As proud Americans, Build the Wall
Donors respect the fact they are citizens of the greatest country in
the World and feel those who live here illegally threaten our
country’s social cohesion and democracy.
