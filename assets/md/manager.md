The Real America Donor audience is made up of patriotic Americans who are boldly
in the fight to not only stop the progressive agenda of the Biden/Harris
Administration, but to see a truly America First administration in the White House.
These America First donors are against big-government spending programs like the
Green New Deal. They want to put an end to the radical Left's socialist agenda such
as anti-energy policies and massive government handouts. They support
Constitutional issues including Second Amendment Rights, Freedom of Speech and
Religion and limited government in the lives of Americans and are concerned with
the crisis unfolding at our nation's southern border.
 
These donors have not grown weary, and they are ready to put their support
behind America First candidates who will fight for the values that have
made America great!
They are for family, faith and individual liberty. These Americans take pride in their
country and are staying in the fight to save America.
