Americans Against the Biden Agenda is compounded of patriotic
Americans who stand against bureaucracy and progressive
doctrine. These donors are averse to tax hikes, federal mandates,
reckless federal spending, gun control, abortion, and other
progressive policy pushed by the Biden administration. Americans
Against the Biden Agenda want an energy independent America
with strong borders and firm policy on illegal immigration.
           
These donors are passionate about supporting truly conservative
candidates that will put America first to secure economic freedom
and prosperity and galvanize American as the leader on the global
playing field. The rights and sovereignty of the individual are
some of the most important values to these donors, and they are
determined to defend their values.
 
A great test for:
Anti-illegal immigration and national security mailers
Gun-rights advocacy groups
Conservative, Republican and America First candidates and advocacy groups
Organizations supporting veterans
Groups from the former “Tea-Party” movement
