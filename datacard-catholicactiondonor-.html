DESCRIPTION

Catholic Action Donors is an ideal list for those looking to reach a
nationwide audience of Catholic Americans.  These highly active
donors are incredibly passionate about advancing the Roman
Catholic way of life, sharing the Gospel and ending abortion. 

These exceedingly responsive and loyal donors have values deeply
rooted in the sanctity of family and support America's Judeo-
Christian heritage as the foundation of our great nation.   They
are firmly pro-life, patriotic, faith-based and will be excellent
prospects for Catholic mission groups, Catholic products and
subscriptions, pro-life groups as well as Catholic and Christian
Conservative political appeals.
