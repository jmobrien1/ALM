DESCRIPTION

 NEW NAMES ADDED!   These staunch pro-life donors are
committed to supporting policy that advances the pro-life movement 
and electing ofﬁcials who will always work to protect and defend the
unborn.

The last 12 month donors are not only crusaders for the right

to life, but also politcally active.   These individuals supported
President Donald Trump in last year's election based on his campaign
promise to advance and defend the pro-life agenda.   While hopeful, 
these donors are diligently watching that the Trump administration
stays committed to the pro-life agenda.
